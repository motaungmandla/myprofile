I am applying for the position of a web developer that I saw advertised by the 2-bros.
I believe I am a good fit for the position because I am still young and I am informed and up to date on the current affairs and I can certainly bring in, new and practical ideas. I have extensive programming experience across a wide range of context and web programming is one of my favourites.

Thank you for the opportunity and I look forward to further discussing working together.
