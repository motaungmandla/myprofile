        <p style="color: white;">I am currently pursuing an undergraduate degree in Mathematics and Computer Science at the National University of Lesotho.
            I am chose my major(s) because I enjoy solving problems and I am generally a practical person. I am both goodat following instructions and
            applying them to real world scenarios. I enjoy physical sports such as football.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p style="color: white;">I have tried many technologies out there and hit a snug from time to time. My technical skills are: Python as a programming language,
            python libraries such as sympy, kivy, tkinter, numpy and many more. I have also programmed javascript especially in webapp projects.
            I have some knowledge of the industries top programming languages such as Ruby, R and Java. I have software development experience even though it was not inline with my course outline.
            I am currently working on deep learning and natural language processing using torch, nltk, spacy and transformers libraries.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p style="color: white;">My interests include: Data analytics, web and software development, web scraping, data mining and deep learning.
            Of course, I enjoy solving and thinking about mathematical problemms and lemmas from a wide range of topics.
